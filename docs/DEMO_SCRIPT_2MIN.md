# PrepSmart - 2 Minute Demo Script

**Total Time**: ~1 minute 50 seconds

## Opening (15 seconds)

"Hi, I'm presenting **PrepSmart** - an AI-powered crisis preparedness assistant that creates personalized survival plans in under 90 seconds.

Right now, people face two major crises: natural disasters like hurricanes and economic emergencies - 900,000 federal workers were just furloughed. Existing solutions are overwhelming 50-page PDFs or expensive $500 survival kits that nobody uses."

## The Solution (20 seconds)

"PrepSmart uses **6 specialized AI agents** working in parallel to create personalized plans based on your location, budget, and situation.

It's **transparent** - you watch the agents work in real-time.
It's **fast** - complete plans in 90 seconds.
It's **budget-conscious** - three tiers from $50 to $200, with free alternatives.
And it costs just 7 cents per plan to run."
